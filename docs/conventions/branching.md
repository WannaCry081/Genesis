# Branching

## Branch Names

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Stable, always deployable |
| `feat/<slug>` | New features |
| `fix/<slug>` | Bug fixes |
| `docs/<slug>` | Documentation |
| `chore/<slug>` | Maintenance, tooling, cleanup |

Keep slugs short and descriptive: `feat/dark-mode`, `fix/null-pointer-login`.

## Rules

- Branch off `main` unless told otherwise.
- Delete branches after they are merged.
- Never commit directly to `main`.
